# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Analysis Using Pandas (Python)

A beginner-friendly but industry-relevant project demonstrating **data cleaning**, **merging**, **sorting**, and **analysis** using the Pandas library in Python.  
This project shows how raw CSV data can be transformed into **clean**, **structured**, and **insightful** reports — a common requirement in real-world backend, analytics, and automation tasks.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on converting messy raw data into meaningful business insights.  
Using Pandas, the project performs:

- Removal of duplicates  
- Handling missing values  
- Sorting data to identify patterns  
- Merging multiple datasets  
- Grouping and aggregating values  
- Generating clean CSV reports  

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in **Python + Pandas**, often expected in backend, data-handling, and automation roles.
